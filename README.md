### Hey there!

I’m **Om**, a Computer Science undergrad who builds and deploys backend and cloud-native systems.

I enjoy designing architectures, testing ideas in real environments, and shipping them end-to-end. If a system design idea seems interesting, I’ll spin it up, deploy it, break it, and fix it until I understand it properly.

I’m 2× Oracle Cloud Infrastructure certified and comfortable working across cloud infrastructure, backend services, and DevOps workflows.

What I work with

Cloud & Infra: AWS, OCI, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform

Backend: Node.js, TypeScript, Go

Architecture: Serverless systems, IAM design, CI/CD, cloud-native patterns

I focus on decisions and trade-offs, not just tools — security, scalability, and reliability matter to me.

What I do

Design and deploy backend services

Build serverless and containerized systems

Experiment with infrastructure to understand how systems behave in production-like setups

Ship projects publicly and iterate on them

Fun facts

I own a guitar and I’m learning to play it

I don’t like coffee or tea

I watch anime even though I say I don’t like it

I play video games purely for fun

Outside of code

Guitar • Gym • Building things
