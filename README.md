### Hey there!

I’m **Om**, a Computer Science undergrad who builds and deploys backend and cloud-native systems.

If a system design idea seems interesting, I’ll spin it up on the cloud, deploy it, break it, and fix it until I understand it properly.

I enjoy designing architectures, testing ideas in real environments, and shipping them end-to-end.

I’m 2× Oracle Cloud Infrastructure certified and comfortable working across cloud infrastructure, backend services, and DevOps workflows.

### What I work with
Cloud & Infra: Linux, AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform  
Backend: Node.js, TypeScript, Go  
Architecture: Serverless systems, IAM design, CI/CD, cloud-native patterns  

I care about engineering decisions and trade-offs, not just tools.  
How systems fail matters as much as how they run — security, scalability, and reliability matter to me.

### Fun facts
- I own a guitar and I’m learning to play it
- I don’t like coffee or tea
- I watch anime even though I say I don’t like it
- I play video games purely for fun

### Outside of code
Guitar • Gym • Building things
